In this world people survive eating food, staying healthy etc. But the most important thing that helps people survive is food which keeps your stomach fill, and gives you  strenght.  People eat food 3-4 times a day.
-Breakfast
-Lunch
-Evening Snack
-Dinner 

The breakfast is mostly the first meal of the day and dinner the last. So you see how food keeps your stomach fill, which helps you to last out the day, You can get by approx 8-21 days without food and water but after that the huger strikes you to starvation and you die.
Food is a big part of our life and we should never waste food (point to be noted).
